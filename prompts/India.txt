<FIELDS>
number 
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND WHAT A VALID PASSPORT NUMBER LOOKS LIKE
A valid Indian passport number must meet all the following criteria:
Length: Exactly 8 characters long.


Structure:


Starts with 1 or 2 uppercase letters.


Followed by 6 or 7 digits.


Restrictions:


No spaces, dashes, slashes, symbols, or lowercase letters.


‚úÖ Examples of Valid Passport Numbers:
Y4187040


AA449211


C5986765


T8888473


P9514027


R0742123


Z5876303


B7345371


X3230575


W9259311


N9723646


S0155122


‚ùå Invalid Examples (NEVER Extract These):
C03063072483320 ‚Üí Too long (File Number)


U69057089 ‚Üí Too many characters


U 6905708 ‚Üí Contains a space


y6905708 ‚Üí Contains a lowercase letter


T/8888473 ‚Üí Contains a slash


AA44921 ‚Üí Too short (only 7 characters)


47305665 ‚Üí Starts with a number



STEP 2: WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE PASSPORT NUMBER
You must extract the passport number from two trusted locations only:
From the Printed Field on Page 1 (Biographic Page):


Look for the exact label ‚ÄúPassport No‚Äù (case-insensitive).


Extract the text immediately following this label.


From the MRZ (Machine-Readable Zone):


Look at MRZ Line 2 (the second of the two bottom lines).


The first 9 characters of this line contain the passport number and a check digit.


Only extract the first 8 characters (ignore the 9th check digit).



STEP 3: CLEAN THE VALUES
Once extracted, clean the values by applying these steps:
Remove all whitespace.


Remove all special characters like: /, -, ., :, _, or any symbols.


Convert all letters to uppercase.


Ensure the value is exactly 8 characters long (letters and digits only).



STEP 4: DECIDE WHICH VALUE TO KEEP
After cleaning, compare the two extracted values:
If both values are present and exactly the same: ‚úÖ Use that value.


If both values are present but different: ‚úÖ Use the MRZ value.


If only one value is present and valid: ‚úÖ Use that value.


If neither value is valid: ‚ùå Return an empty string ("").



STEP 5: REJECTION RULES
Reject any value that meets any of the following criteria:
Length is not exactly 8 characters.


Contains slashes, dashes, dots, spaces, or symbols.


Comes from a label like ‚ÄúFile Number‚Äù or ‚ÄúOld Passport Number‚Äù.


Found in barcodes or addresses.


Looks like a serial number or is too long (e.g., starts with C03...).



STEP 6: EXAMPLES FOR EVERY CASE
‚úÖ Valid Cases:
OCR: "Passport No: U6905708"


MRZ Line 2: U6905708<3IND...


Result: Use: U6905708


OCR: Y 4187040 ‚Üí cleaned ‚Üí Y4187040


MRZ: Y4187040<5IND...


Result: Match ‚Üí Use: Y4187040


OCR: "passport no: aa449211"


MRZ: AA449211<2IND...


Cleaned OCR: AA449211


Result: Use: AA449211


‚ö†Ô∏è Difference Case (OCR Error):
OCR: "Passport No: U690S708" (OCR error ‚Äî misread 5 as S)


MRZ: U6905708<3IND...


Result: Use the MRZ value: U6905708 (since they differ)


‚ùå Reject Cases:
OCR: File No: C03063072483320


Reason: Too long ‚Üí Reject.


MRZ: C0306307<4IND...


Reason: Invalid prefix from File Number ‚Üí Reject.


Barcode: Y238747712345


Reason: More than 8 characters ‚Üí Reject.


"Old Passport No: T4882211"


Reason: Wrong label ‚Üí Reject.


country 
ISO 3166‚Äë1 alpha‚Äë3 code from OCR or MRZ: Always Use ‚ÄúIND‚Äù for country field


name 
Objective:
Extract the complete given name(s) of the passport holder without cutting or missing any part.
üõ† Step-by-Step Instructions:
Extract Two Versions of the Given Name:


mrzGivenName:


From MRZ Line 1, extract everything after the first << until the end of the line.


ocrGivenName:


From Page 1, extract the value exactly next to the label ‚ÄúGiven Name(s)‚Äù (case-insensitive exact match).


It will always be located below the surname in terms of Y-coordinates in the image.


Clean Both Extracted Values:


Replace every < character with a space.


Collapse multiple spaces into a single space.


Trim leading and trailing spaces.


Selection Rule:


If mrzGivenName is available (non-empty and readable), always use mrzGivenName even if it‚Äôs slightly different from ocrGivenName.


If mrzGivenName is missing, unreadable, or invalid, use ocrGivenName.


Important: Always use the full extracted string as-is after cleaning ‚Äî no splitting, no guessing, no truncation.


‚ùå STRICT RULES: DO NOT:
Do not split the name into parts (keep the full name together as one field).


Do not pick only a part (e.g., avoid picking only "Kaur" if the full name is "Husanpreet Kaur").


Do not remove parts based on assumptions like family name, middle name, initials, etc.


Do not guess missing parts or correct perceived errors manually.


Do not pull from other fields like ‚ÄúSurname‚Äù, ‚ÄúNationality‚Äù, etc.


MRZ Extract Examples:
MRZ Extract: <<JINCY ‚Üí Final Name: JINCY


MRZ Extract: <<HETAL<GANESH ‚Üí Final Name: HETAL GANESH


MRZ Extract: <<OMANA<JAMES<THOMAS ‚Üí Final Name: OMANA JAMES THOMAS


MRZ Extract: <<SUMANDEEP<KAUR ‚Üí Final Name: SUMANDEEP KAUR


MRZ Extract: <<RAFIQA<AKHTER ‚Üí Final Name: RAFIQA AKHTER


‚ö° Final Tip:
‚úÖ Always trust MRZ fully if available, because it‚Äôs generated electronically.


‚úÖ OCR should only be used as a backup if the MRZ fails.


surname 
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Extract two versions of the surname:


mrzSurname: From MRZ Line 1, extract the text after P<IND and before the first <<.


ocrSurname: From Page 1, extract the value next to the label "Surname" (case-insensitive exact match). It is typically located above the given names, usually being the topmost field in Y-coordinates in OCR.


Clean both extracted values:


Replace every < with a space.


Collapse multiple spaces into a single space.


Trim leading and trailing whitespace.


Selection Rule:


If both versions are available and different, always use mrzSurname.


If mrzSurname is unreadable or missing, use ocrSurname.


‚ùåDO NOTS (ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN BEHAVIOR):
Do NOT include IND in the surname ‚Äî The string "IND" is part of the MRZ prefix and must be excluded.


Do NOT shorten or guess surnames ‚Äî Always extract the full printed surname exactly as it appears.


Do NOT extract anything from the "Given Name(s)" field and treat it as the surname.


Do NOT extract names from the address block, "Place of Birth", "Place of Issue", or any other unrelated sections.


Do NOT use "Name of Spouse" (from Page 2) as the surname:


Even if it appears near the top or bottom of the document.


Even if it contains a plausible name.


Even if the surname field is empty, never use the spouse name.


Do NOT use "Name of Mother" as the surname:


Even if it contains a plausible family name.


Even if the surname field is empty or unclear.


Even if the mother‚Äôs name appears higher or bolder than other fields, it is not the surname.


Do NOT mix names from different fields in the passport:


Each name field must come only from its exact label.


Do not assign the father‚Äôs name to the surname field, or the mother‚Äôs name to the given name, etc.


No substitutions between fields are allowed under any condition.


Do NOT infer or fabricate any part of the name based on proximity, alignment, or assumptions.
Examples:
MRZ: P<INDKOIKKARANPARAMBIL<JUDY<<JINCY ‚Üí Extracted Surname: KOIKKARANPARAMBIL JUDY


OCR: KOIKKARANPARAMBIL JUDY ‚Üí Result: Same as MRZ ‚Üí Accept.


MRZ: P<INDSHARMA<KUMAR<<AMIT ‚Üí Extracted Surname: SHARMA KUMAR (even if OCR says "SHAR")


middle name
Always keep middle name as empty string (‚Äú‚Äù)
gender 
OCR Candidate:
Source: Extract gender from the OCR text.


Format: The gender is typically represented as "M" for Male and "F" for Female in the OCR text.
MRZ Candidate:
Source: Extract gender from mrzLine2.


The gender is located at position 21 of mrzLine2.


Format: The gender is represented as "M" for Male, "F" for Female, or X for a non-binary gender (if applicable in the MRZ).


place of birth 
Extraction Source: Text associated with the "Place of Birth" label on Page 1 (Biographic Page).
Cleaning and Validation (Emphasis on Fidelity)
Prioritize OCR Fidelity
 Extract text exactly as it appears in the OCR output. Do not substitute based on external knowledge or assumptions.
 Example: KAUSHAMBI UTTAR PRADESH should remain as KAUSHAMBI UTTAR PRADESH, not "KAUSHAMBI, UTTAR PRADESH".


Comma Handling
 Remove all commas (,). If the comma separates city and state, replace it with a space.
 Example: KAUSHAMBI, UTTAR PRADESH -> KAUSHAMBI UTTAR PRADESH.
 If commas exist within other parts of the place name (e.g., NEW YORK, NY), remove the comma and ensure no additional space is added unless separating distinct words.


Special Character Normalization
 Replace hyphens (-), slashes (/), and parentheses () with a single space.
 Example: MUMBAI-ANDHERI -> MUMBAI ANDHERI.
 Example: KOLKATA/DELHI -> KOLKATA DELHI.
 Example: (NEW DELHI) -> NEW DELHI.


Whitespace Cleanup
 Collapse multiple spaces into one. Trim leading and trailing spaces from the extracted text.
 Example: MUMBAI MAHARASHTRA -> MUMBAI MAHARASHTRA.


Conservative OCR Correction
 Apply minor corrections only if the error is clear and of high confidence.
 Example: KOVvURU -> KOVVURU.
 Example: DELHI instead of DILHI.
 Note: Do not correct unless the error is absolutely clear and high-confidence.


Strict Anti-Hallucination
Do not replace or correct extracted text with a different place name, even if OCR output seems incomplete or misspelled.
Example: GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH -> Output should be GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH (‚ùå NOT VIJAYAWADA).
Example: HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT -> Output should be HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT (‚ùå NOT KAPAD KEDALA GUJARAT).


Preserve Full Place Name
 Ensure the entire place name is preserved, including city, district, and state.
 Example: KARAR WALA PUNJAB -> KARAR WALA PUNJAB.


Final Value
After applying the cleaning rules, the final value should be the cleaned, minimally corrected (if applicable), fully in UPPERCASE full string from OCR.
Example: After cleaning GUDUR, ANDHRA PRADESH, the final output should be GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH.



Examples
OCR: GUDUR, ANDHRA Pradesh
Cleaned: GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH
Final Place of Birth: "GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH"


OCR: VIJAYAWADA
Cleaned: VIJAYAWADA
Final Place of Birth: "VIJAYAWADA"


OCR: KARAR MALA PUNJAB
Possible Correction: KARAR WALA PUNJAB
Final Place of Birth: "KARAR WALA PUNJAB" (Use correction only if high confidence)


OCR: HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT
Cleaned: HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT
Final Place of Birth: "HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT" (Prioritize fidelity if correction unsure)


OCR: HARIL, JHARKHAND
Cleaned: HARIL JHARKHAND
Final Place of Birth: "HARIL JHARKHAND"


birth date 
Extract the Birth Date from OCR:


Source: Capture the birth date from the OCR text, specifically the field labeled "original birth date".


Format: The OCR birth date should be in DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., "16/06/1972").


If the OCR birth date is invalid (e.g., malformed or missing), this field will need to be validated against the MRZ value.


Extract the Birth Date from MRZ:


Source: The MRZ data contains the birth date in Line 2, specifically from positions 14 to 19.


Format: The birth date in the MRZ is in the YYMMDD format. To convert it to the required DD/MM/YYYY format, perform the following:


Extract the value from positions 14-19 of mrzLine2.


For Example: The MRZ line is: "P6102238B8IND7206166F3101148<<<<<<<<<<<<<<04".


The date of birth from this MRZ line is located at positions 14-19 and is "720616", which corresponds to 16/06/1972 (the 14th and 15th digits represent the year, 1972, the 16th and 17th digits represent the month, 06, and the 18th and 19th digits represent the day, 16).


Validation:


Step 1: Check if both the OCR birth date and the MRZ date of birth are valid.


If both are valid and in DD/MM/YYYY format:


Step 2: If the OCR birth date and MRZ date of birth differ, use the MRZ date of birth as the final value for the birth date field.


If the OCR date is invalid or missing:


Step 3: If the MRZ date of birth is valid, use the MRZ date of birth for the final birth date.


Final Output:


The final birth date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format, regardless of whether it came from OCR or MRZ.


If the date is extracted from the MRZ and is in YYMMDD format, convert it to DD/MM/YYYY.


issue date 
Format: The issue date must be extracted in DD/MM/YYYY format.
Strict Requirement:
Extract only from the designated OCR "Date of Issue" field, exactly as it is labeled on the passport page.


The OCR field specifically labeled as "Date of Issue" is the only source for the issue date. No other information or fields can be used to infer or generate the issue date (e.g., not using MRZ data, expiry date, or date of birth).


Conditions for Invalid or Missing Data:
If any part of the date (day, month, or year) within the "Date of Issue" field is absent, illegible, or significantly obscured after OCR attempts, the entire issue date field must be output as empty ("").


This includes cases where only part of the issue date (e.g., the day, month, or year) is missing or unreadable in the OCR data.


No inference or guesswork is allowed. The issue date must come directly from the OCR data and cannot be constructed or calculated using any other field (such as MRZ, expiry date, or document lifespan rules).


Contextual Interpretation of Year (YY):
If the year is two digits (YY) and the century (i.e., 1900s vs. 2000s) is not explicitly clear from the OCR, you may interpret the century based on context, but only if the two-digit year (YY) is clearly readable in the "Date of Issue" field.


Example: If the OCR shows "15/06/20", and the expiry date is far in the future (e.g., 2030), then you can reasonably infer that "20" refers to 2020.


However, you cannot guess or infer any part of the date (including the month or year) if it is not directly available in the OCR "Date of Issue" field.


Validation with Expiry Date:


Once extracted, the issue date must logically precede the expiry date (if both are available and valid).


If the issue date is invalid or missing, output "".


expiry date 
Format: The expiry date must be extracted in DD/MM/YYYY format.


Source for Expiry Date:


OCR Source: Extract the expiry date from the field labeled "original expiry date" in the OCR text.


MRZ Source: The expiry date is also available in MRZ Line 2, from positions 22-27 (in YYMMDD format).


Validation Process:


Step 1: If both the OCR expiry date and MRZ expiry date are valid (i.e., both are in DD/MM/YYYY format):


Step 2: If the OCR expiry date and MRZ expiry date differ, the MRZ date must be used for the final expiry date.


Step 3: If the OCR expiry date is invalid or missing, but the MRZ expiry date is valid, use the MRZ expiry date for the final expiry date.


Logical Date Check:


The final expiry date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format and should be logically after the issue date.


If the expiry date is logically before the issue date, or the expiry date is more than 20 years after the issue date, it must be considered invalid.


Contextual Interpretation of Year (YY):


If the MRZ expiry date is in YYMMDD format (e.g., "2031" as "31"), convert it to DD/MM/YYYY.


If the year part is two digits (YY), determine the century based on context, such as the issue date or typical expiry range (e.g., if the issue date is in 2020, interpret "31" as 2031).


place of issue 
Source:


The place of issue must be extracted from the OCR text, specifically from the field labeled "place of issue" or similar in the passport image.
Extraction Source: Text associated with the "Place of Issue" label on Page 1 (Biographic Page).
Critical: Do NOT confuse with "Place of Birth."


Assignment Rule: Use the cleaned OCR value (apply standard cleaning as per above).
If "Place of Issue" is blank or unreadable on Page 1, set place of issue to "".


Examples


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": RANCHI
Result: place of issue = "RANCHI"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": MUSKAT
Result: place of issue = "MUSKAT"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": CHANDIGARH
Result: place of issue = "CHANDIGARH"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": (blank/unreadable)
Result: place of issue = ""


country of issue 
Assignment Rule
If the place of issue is inside India (e.g., RANCHI, DELHI, MUMBAI), set country of issue = "INDIA".
If the place of issue is outside India (e.g., MUSCAT, DOHA, LONDON, DUBAI, etc.), set country of issue accordingly (e.g., OMAN, QATAR, UNITED KINGDOM, UAE, etc.).


If the place of issue is "", then the country of issue must be "".
Examples
Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": RANCHI
Result: country of issue = "INDIA"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": MUSKAT
Result: country of issue = "OMAN"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": CHANDIGARH
Result: country of issue = "INDIA"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": (blank/unreadable)
Result: country of issue = ""
mother name
Objective: Extract only the first word of the mother's full name.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Go to Page 2 of the passport.


Locate the exact label "Name of Mother" (case-insensitive but exact wording).


Extract the full text immediately following this label:


The same line or the line immediately after.


Do not read from other areas.


Clean the extracted text:


Normalize whitespace (collapse multiple spaces into one).


Remove punctuation or unwanted characters.


Trim leading/trailing spaces.


Split the cleaned string by space.


Return only the first word as the mother‚Äôs name.


DO NOT
‚ùå Do not extract from "Name of Father" or "Name of Spouse" fields.


‚ùå Do not take more than one word.


‚ùå Do not merge words.

FINAL CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES
Must Do:
‚úÖ Use exact label matches only.


‚úÖ Never guess names based on nearby text.


‚úÖ Always fully clean extracted text.


‚úÖ Never swap or confuse fields (Father ‚â† Mother).


‚úÖ The Father‚Äôs name will always be positioned above the Mother‚Äôs name in the document. Ensure that the Y-coordinate of the text for "Name of Father / Legal Guardian" is higher than the Y-coordinate for "Name of Mother" to avoid confusion.


Must Not Do:


‚ùå Always extract from the correct field.


‚ùå Never use spouse names, addresses, etc.


‚ùå Return an empty string if missing.


‚ùå Never hallucinate missing names.

father name 
Objective: Extract the full name of the father or legal guardian.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Go to Page 2 of the passport.


Locate the exact label "Name of Father / Legal Guardian" (case-insensitive but exact wording).


Extract the full text directly following this label:


Either on the same line.


Or the line immediately after if wrapped.


Do not read from any other area.


Clean the extracted text:


Normalize spaces (collapse multiple spaces into one).


Remove surrounding noise characters (punctuation like ., ,, ;, etc.).


Trim leading and trailing spaces.


Return the entire cleaned string as the father's name.

Special Instructions for Missing or Blank Fields
If the "Name of Father / Legal Guardian" field is missing, unreadable, or blank, return an empty string (""), not a guess from any other field.


mrzLine1
Rule: Extract the full MRZ Line 1 including the padding < characters.


Explanation: MRZ Line 1 is used in the passport to store key data, such as the surname, first name, passport number, and other relevant details. Ensure to preserve the full line exactly as it appears in the OCR, including padding (<).

mrzLine2 
Rule: Extract the full MRZ Line 2 including the padding < characters.


Explanation: MRZ Line 2 contains important information such as date of birth, date of expiry, nationality, and personal identifiers. The full line must be extracted and preserved with the < padding.


mrzDateOfBirth
Source: Strictly parse from mrzLine2.
Location: The date of birth is located at positions 14-19 in mrzLine2, formatted as YYMMDD.
Rule: Map the date from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY format.
For Example:


If mrzLine2 contains "P6102238B8IND7206166F3101148", the mrzDateOfBirth is "720616".


This corresponds to 16/06/1972 (DD/MM/YYYY).


mrzDateOfExpiry
Source: Strictly parse from mrzLine2.
Location: The date of birth is located at positions 22-27 in mrzLine2, formatted as YYMMDD.
Rule: Map the date from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY format.
Example:
If mrzLine2 contains "P6102238B8IND7206166F3101148", the mrzDateOfBirth is "720616".


This corresponds to 16/06/1972 (DD/MM/YYYY).


original number
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring representing the passport number.
Explanation: The original number should be preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR text, even if it is invalid or rejected later. This field contains the raw OCR token before any validation or modification takes place.
Example: If the OCR output is "Y4187040", then original number will be "Y4187040".
original country
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring for the country code.
Explanation: This field should contain the unmodified OCR country code exactly as it appears.
Example: If the OCR text is "IND" for the Philippines, the original country will be "IND".
original birth date
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring for the birth date.
Rule: The original birth date should be converted to DD/MM/YYYY format.
Example: If the OCR text is "16/06/1972", the original birth date will be "16/06/1972" after conversion (if it's already in valid format, no changes are needed).
original gender
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring for the gender field.
Explanation: This field should contain the raw OCR gender token exactly as it appears.
Example: If the OCR output is "F" (Female), then original gender will be "F".
original expiry date 
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring for the expiry date.
Rule: The original expiry date should be converted to DD/MM/YYYY format.
Example: If the OCR text is "14/01/2031", the original expiry date will be "14/01/2031" after conversion (if it's already in valid format, no changes are needed).


<USER>
Step-by-Step Extraction and Validation Process
1. OCR Pass 1: Initial Extraction
Action: Run the highest-accuracy OCR engine on the passport image.


Extraction: Attempt to extract all the necessary fields for the JSON based on layout rules, keywords, and patterns.


Initial Cleaning: Apply basic cleanup to the raw OCR data:


Trim leading and trailing whitespace.


Normalize multiple spaces within text (e.g., replace consecutive spaces with a single space).


Correct common OCR misreads (e.g., interpreting "O" as "0", "I" as "1" when contextually applicable).


Output: Store the cleaned results in a temporary structure called OCR_Result_Pass1.


2. Validation Pass 1: Field-Level Check
Action: Validate the fields extracted in OCR_Result_Pass1.


Validation:


Ensure the format of each field is correct (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY for dates).


Ensure the length is correct (e.g., passport number must be 9 characters).


Ensure the content matches expected values (e.g., country codes, gender codes).


Ensure logical consistency (e.g., birth date must be before issue date).


Output: Store the validation status in Validation_Status_Pass1 (e.g., { isValid: true, reason: null } or { isValid: false, reason: "Invalid format" }).


3. OCR Pass 2: Secondary Extraction
Action: Run the same OCR engine on the same image to capture potential variations in OCR results.


Extraction: Repeat the extraction process and apply the same cleanup rules as in OCR Pass 1.


Output: Store the results in OCR_Result_Pass2.


4. Validation Pass 2: Field-Level Check
Action: Validate the fields extracted in OCR_Result_Pass2 using the same rules as in Pass 1.


Output: Store the validation status in Validation_Status_Pass2.


5. Field-Level Consolidation Based on Validation Status
Action: Consolidate the data by comparing the results of Pass 1 and Pass 2.


If Pass 1 is valid and Pass 2 is invalid, use the data from Pass 1.


If Pass 1 is invalid and Pass 2 is valid, use the data from Pass 2.


If both passes are valid, prioritize Pass 1.


If both passes are invalid, use the Pass 1 data tentatively (with reason flags for review).


Output: Create a consolidated dataset Consolidated_Data and a corresponding status tracker Consolidated_Status.


6. MRZ Extraction & Validation
Action: Extract MRZ fields from mrzLine1 and mrzLine2:


mrzLine1: Extract the full line with padding <.


mrzLine2: Extract the full line with padding <.


mrzPassportNumber: Extract from positions 1-9 in mrzLine2.


mrzDateOfBirth: Extract from positions 14-19 in mrzLine2 (convert from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY).


mrzDateOfExpiry: Extract from positions 22-27 in mrzLine2 (convert from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY).


mrzSex: Extract from position 21 in mrzLine2.


mrzSurname: Extract from positions 6 to first << in mrzLine1.


mrzGivenNames: Extract from the remaining part of mrzLine1 after the surname.


7. Final Cross-Validation & Reconciliation
Action: Reconcile the data from OCR_Result_Pass1, OCR_Result_Pass2, and MRZ data:


If both OCR and MRZ data are valid but differ, MRZ data takes precedence.


If either OCR or MRZ data is invalid, use the valid data from the other source.


For fields like issue date, expiry date, birth date, ensure the dates are logically ordered (e.g., expiry date should come after issue date).


8. Date Sanity Check
Action: Verify that the birth date is less than or equal to the issue date, and the issue date is less than the expiry date. If not, prioritize MRZ dates if valid.


9. Final JSON Construction
Action: Assemble the final validated JSON object using the consolidated data from Consolidated_Data after all validation, reconciliation, and sanity checks.


Ensure:


Invalid or missing fields are set to empty string ("").


The output JSON structure strictly follows the required key order.
Please extract and return the data in exactly the JSON structure below (no extra keys, no extra text).
