name
Steps for Extraction & Cleaning:
Extract Name from OCR:


Capture the given names from the OCR text.


Clean the OCR Name:


Replace hyphens ("‑") with spaces.


Remove apostrophes.


Strip diacritics (accent marks) from all characters.


Extract Name from MRZ (mrzGivenNames):


Capture the given names from the MRZ text (from mrzGivenNames field).


Compare OCR Name with MRZ Name:


If the MRZ Name is non-empty and longer than one character, compare the OCR name with the MRZ name.

middle name 
Steps for Extraction & Cleaning:
Extract form OCR:
Extract the labeled middle name field from the OCR.


Clean the Middle Name:


Apostrophe Removal: Remove any apostrophes in the names.


Diacritic Stripping: Remove all diacritical marks (accents) from characters, e.g., Á → A, Ñ → N.


Special Character Replacement:


Replace slashes ("/") with spaces.


Replace parentheses ("( )") with spaces.


gender
M, F; prefer MRZ if conflicting.
place of birth
1. Extract from OCR Next to “Place of Birth”:
Capture the place of birth from the OCR text.


2. Remove Commas:
Remove any commas that exist in the place of birth.


Example:
CALUBIAN, LEYTE → CALUBIAN LEYTE


DASMARIÑAS, CAV → DASMARINAS CAV


3. Translate Non-Latin Characters to English:
If the place of birth contains non-Latin characters, translate them into their English equivalent.


Example:
DASMARIÑAS CAV → DASMARIÑAS CAV (Spanish "Ñ" replaced with Latin "N")


PARAÑAQUE MM → PARANAQUE MM (Spanish "Ñ" replaced with Latin "N")


4. Replace Special Characters:
Replace special characters like hyphens ("‑"), slashes ("/"), and parentheses ("( )") with spaces.


Example:
MATAG-OB LEYTE → MATAG OB LEYTE


TAGANA-AN SGO DN → TAGANA AN SGO DN


5. Collapse Duplicates in Parentheses:
If the place of birth contains duplicate entries within parentheses, collapse them into one instance.


Example:
(LEYTE) (LEYTE) → (LEYTE)


6. Auto-Correct OCR Variants of Common Place Names:
Automatically correct common OCR misinterpretations of place names (such as misreading or incomplete text).


Examples:
MANILA → MANILA (even if OCR scans miss some characters, correct them)


DAVAD CITY → DAVAO CITY (correct OCR variants)


BAYAWAN NL OR → BAYAWAN NEG OR (correct OCR error)


7. Never Add Spaces Where None Existed:
Do not insert any spaces if they were not originally present in the place of birth.


Examples:
DAVAO CITY → DAVAO CITY (No spaces added if none existed)


CALUBIAN LEYTE → CALUBIAN LEYTE (Do not insert unnecessary spaces)


birth date 
Extract the Birth Date from OCR:
Source: Capture the birth date from the OCR text, specifically the field labeled "original birth date".


Format: The OCR birth date should be in DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., "16/06/1972").


If the OCR birth date is invalid (e.g., malformed or missing), this field will need to be validated against the MRZ value.


Extract the Birth Date from MRZ:
Source: The MRZ data contains the birth date in Line 2, specifically from positions 14 to 19.


Format: The birth date in the MRZ is in the YYMMDD format. To convert it to the required DD/MM/YYYY format, perform the following:


Extract the value from positions 14-19 of mrzLine2.


For Example: The MRZ line is: "P6102238B8PHL7206166F3101148<<<<<<<<<<<<<<04".


The date of birth from this MRZ line is located at positions 14-19 and is "720616", which corresponds to 16/06/1972 (the 14th and 15th digits represent the year, 1972, the 16th and 17th digits represent the month, 06, and the 18th and 19th digits represent the day, 16).


Validation:


Step 1: Check if both the OCR birth date and the MRZ date of birth are valid.


If both are valid and in DD/MM/YYYY format:


Step 2: If the OCR birth date and MRZ date of birth differ, use the MRZ date of birth as the final value for the birth date field.


If the OCR date is invalid or missing:


Step 3: If the MRZ date of birth is valid, use the MRZ date of birth for the final birth date.


Final Output:


The final birth date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format, regardless of whether it came from OCR or MRZ.


If the date is extracted from the MRZ and is in YYMMDD format, convert it to DD/MM/YYYY.


issue date 
Format: The issue date must be extracted in DD/MM/YYYY format.
Strict Requirement:
Extract only from the designated OCR "Date of Issue" field, exactly as it is labeled on the passport page.


The OCR field specifically labeled as "Date of Issue" is the only source for the issue date. No other information or fields can be used to infer or generate the issue date (e.g., not using MRZ data, expiry date, or date of birth).


Conditions for Invalid or Missing Data:
If any part of the date (day, month, or year) within the "Date of Issue" field is absent, illegible, or significantly obscured after OCR attempts, the entire issue date field must be output as empty ("").


This includes cases where only part of the issue date (e.g., the day, month, or year) is missing or unreadable in the OCR data.


No inference or guesswork is allowed. The issue date must come directly from the OCR data and cannot be constructed or calculated using any other field (such as MRZ, expiry date, or document lifespan rules).


Contextual Interpretation of Year (YY):
If the year is two digits (YY) and the century (i.e., 1900s vs. 2000s) is not explicitly clear from the OCR, you may interpret the century based on context, but only if the two-digit year (YY) is clearly readable in the "Date of Issue" field.


Example: If the OCR shows "15/06/20", and the expiry date is far in the future (e.g., 2030), then you can reasonably infer that "20" refers to 2020.


However, you cannot guess or infer any part of the date (including the month or year) if it is not directly available in the OCR "Date of Issue" field.


Validation with Expiry Date:


Once extracted, the issue date must logically precede the expiry date (if both are available and valid).


If the issue date is invalid or missing, output "".


expiry date 
Format: The expiry date must be extracted in DD/MM/YYYY format.
Source for Expiry Date:
OCR Source: Extract the expiry date from the field labeled "original expiry date" in the OCR text.


MRZ Source: The expiry date is also available in MRZ Line 2, from positions 22-27 (in YYMMDD format).
Validation Process:
Step 1: If both the OCR expiry date and MRZ expiry date are valid (i.e., both are in DD/MM/YYYY format):


Step 2: If the OCR expiry date and MRZ expiry date differ, the MRZ date must be used for the final expiry date.


Step 3: If the OCR expiry date is invalid or missing, but the MRZ expiry date is valid, use the MRZ expiry date for the final expiry date.
Logical Date Check:
The final expiry date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format and should be logically after the issue date.


If the expiry date is logically before the issue date, or the expiry date is more than 20 years after the issue date, it must be considered invalid.


Contextual Interpretation of Year (YY):


If the MRZ expiry date is in YYMMDD format (e.g., "2031" as "31"), convert it to DD/MM/YYYY.


If the year part is two digits (YY), determine the century based on context, such as the issue date or typical expiry range (e.g., if the issue date is in 2020, interpret "31" as 2031).


place of issue 
Source:
The place of issue must be extracted from the OCR text, specifically from the field labeled "place of issue" or similar in the passport image.
Correct Minor OCR Noise:


Correct minor OCR errors related to prefix or city names. These may include misinterpreted or incomplete characters in OCR scans.


For example:


OCR: "DFA CAGAYAN DE ORO" → Correct as "DFA CAGAYAN DE ORO".


OCR: "PE RIYADH" → Correct as "PE RIYADH".


OCR: "PE PIYADH" → Correct as "PE RIYADH" (fix OCR misinterpretation).


OCR: "DFA TUKURAN ZAM DS" → Correct as "DFA TUGUEGARAO ZAMBOANGA DEL SUR" (fix OCR error with city).


Place of Issue Should Be Recognized as Valid:
The place of issue should be recognized as valid based on the corrected OCR output.


If the extracted place of issue includes prefixes like DFA, PCG, or PE followed by a city, it should be accepted as the valid place of issue.


country of issue
Derivation Rules:
PE/PCG + City Mapping:


If the place of issue begins with "PE" or "PCG", followed by a city name, map it to the corresponding country the city is located in.


Example:


PE DUBAI → UAE


PE DOHA → QATAR


PE MANAMA → BAHRAIN


PE MOSCOW → RUSSIA


PE RIYADH → SAUDI ARABIA


PCG DUBAI → UAE


PCG MANILA → PHILIPPINES


Invalid Country Mapping:


Example of incorrect mappings:


PE DUBAI → PHILIPPINES ❌ (Incorrect country)


PE DOHA → UAE ❌ (Incorrect country)


2. Special Mapping Rules:
DFA or MECO TAIPEI Mapping:


If the place of issue starts with "DFA" or is exactly "MECO TAIPEI", map it to the Philippines.


Example:


DFA MANILA → PHILIPPINES


MECO TAIPEI → TAIWAN


PCG City Mapping:


For PCG followed by a city:


PCG MACAU → CHINA


PCG HONG KONG → HONG KONG


HMPO Mapping:


If the place of issue starts with "HMPO", map it to the United Kingdom.


Example:


HMPO LONDON → UNITED KINGDOM


Stand-Alone City Mapping:
If the place of issue is a stand-alone city, map it to its corresponding country. This applies to certain cities that are recognized as cities on their own and are internationally recognized as part of specific countries.


Example Cities and Mapped Countries:


DUBAI → UAE


DOHA → QATAR


ISTANBUL → TURKEY


BEIRUT → LEBANON


MOSCOW → RUSSIA


RIYADH → SAUDI ARABIA


KUWAIT → KUWAIT


BAHRAIN → BAHRAIN


HONG KONG → HONG KONG


CHINA → CHINA

mrzLine1
Rule: Extract the full MRZ Line 1 including the padding < characters.
Explanation: MRZ Line 1 is used in the passport to store key data, such as the surname, first name, passport number, and other relevant details. Ensure to preserve the full line exactly as it appears in the OCR, including padding (<).
mrzLine2 
Rule: Extract the full MRZ Line 2 including the padding < characters.
Explanation: MRZ Line 2 contains important information such as date of birth, date of expiry, nationality, and personal identifiers. The full line must be extracted and preserved with the < padding.

Source: Strictly parse from mrzLine2.
Location: The date of birth is located at positions 14-19 in mrzLine2, formatted as YYMMDD.
Rule: Map the date from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY format.
For Example:


If mrzLine2 contains "P6102238B8PHL7206166F3101148", the mrzDateOfBirth is "720616".


This corresponds to 16/06/1972 (DD/MM/YYYY).


mrzDateOfExpiry
Source: Strictly parse from mrzLine2.
Location: The date of birth is located at positions 22-27 in mrzLine2, formatted as YYMMDD.
Rule: Map the date from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY format.
Example:
If mrzLine2 contains "P6102238B8PHL7206166F3101148", the mrzDateOfBirth is "720616".


This corresponds to 16/06/1972 (DD/MM/YYYY).


original number
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring representing the passport number.
Explanation: The original number should be preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR text, even if it is invalid or rejected later. This field contains the raw OCR token before any validation or modification takes place.
Example: If the OCR output is "P6102238B", then original number will be "P6102238B".

original gender
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring for the gender field.
Explanation: This field should contain the raw OCR gender token exactly as it appears.
Example: If the OCR output is "F" (Female), then the original gender will be "F".
original expiry date 
Source: Extract the raw, unmodified OCR substring for the expiry date.
Rule: The original expiry date should be converted to DD/MM/YYYY format.
Example:
OCR Expiry date: 12 DEC 2024

number
Extraction Sources
MRZ candidate – take characters 1‑9 of mrzLine2 (immediately after the first <).


OCR candidate – locate the first 9‑character token in the cleaned OCR text that begins with an uppercase “P”.


Each candidate is processed independently through the validation pipeline.
 After validation, select the output with the priority order:
Valid MRZ candidate


Valid OCR candidate


"" (if both invalid)


Always store the raw, un‑converted OCR token (if found) in original number, even if it is later rejected.
Validation & Mandatory Conversion Pipeline
Run the following four checks in strict order for every candidate.
 If any check fails, immediately reject the candidate.
Length Check


The token must be exactly 9 characters.


Anything shorter or longer is invalid (e.g. P1234567, length 8 → reject).


Prefix Check


Position 1 must be an uppercase “P”.


Lower‑case p or any other letter causes rejection (e.g. p12345678 → reject).


Digit‑Block Check


Positions 2 through 8 must all be digits (0‑9).


If any character in that block is non‑digit—letters, punctuation, spaces—the candidate is invalid
 (e.g. P12A45678 → reject).


Last‑Character Processing


If the 9th character is A, B, or C, keep it unchanged.


If the 9th character is 8, convert it to B.


If the 9th character is 0, convert it to C.


Any other character (including 1‑7 or 9 or letters other than A/B/C) → reject.


After step 4, the token is considered valid.
Return the converted value as number (always 9 characters).
Quick Reference Examples
Valid after conversion
P06393008 → P0639300B   (‘8’ converted to ‘B’)


P06393000 → P0639300C   (‘0’ converted to ‘C’)


P00000008 → P0000000B   (‘8’ converted to ‘B’)


Valid already compliant
P4567890C → stays P4567890C


P1234567A → stays P1234567A


P1234567B → stays P1234567B


P1234567C → stays P1234567C


Invalid (rejection examples)
P1234567    → reject (only 8 chars)


P123456789  → reject (9th char ‘9’ is not convertible)


A12345678B  → reject (does not start with ‘P’)


P1234567BC  → reject (10 chars)


P12A45678C  → reject (letter in digit block)


P123456D8   → reject (letter ‘D’ in digit block)


PABCDEFGH   → reject (positions 2‑8 are not digits)


Return validated_number if the candidate survives all checks; otherwise reject.
Compliance Notes
Never modify positions 2‑8 except to confirm they are digits.


Ensure the returned string is always length 9.


Keep a transient debug log of rejected tokens and reasons only during development; purge logs and raw data in production to satisfy GDPR.
place of birth
1. Extract from OCR Next to “Place of Birth”:
Capture the place of birth from the OCR text.


2. Remove Commas:
Remove any commas that exist in the place of birth.
Failed Examples (Corrections Needed):
The following examples do not follow the above rules and need corrections. Here are the correct mappings:
CALUBIAN LEYTE → CALUBIAN LEYTE (Correct, but don't add extra characters like "LEYTEAL")


BAYAWAN NL OR → BAYAWAN NEG OR (Correcting OCR error "NL" to "NEG")


SALCEDO ILS SR → SALCEDO ILS SR (It should be "SALCEDO ILS SR", no truncation)


MATAG-OB LEYTE → MATAG OB LEYTE (Correct replacement of hyphen with space)


TAGANA-AN SGO DN → TAGANA AN SGO DN (Correct replacement of hyphen with space)


PASSI ILOILO → PASSI ILOILO (No change needed, ensure OCR variants are handled)


PARAÑAQUE MM → PARANAQUE MM (Correct "Ñ" to "N")


NABUNTURAN DAVAO → NABUNTURAN DAVAO (Correct OCR error, change "NABUNTURA" to "NABUNTURAN")


LAUA-AN ANTIQUE → LAUA AN ANTIQUE (Correct hyphen to space)


DAVAD CITY → DAVAO CITY (Correct OCR error)
CASE 2: Ethiopia - ETH - Ethiopian
Scope
 Apply this section only when:
The MRZ country code (mrzLine1 characters 3‑5) is ETH, or


The previously extracted country field equals ETH.


These rules override the master prompt only for the fields explicitly listed below.
number
Extraction Sources (in priority order)
MRZ candidate – characters 1‑9 of mrzLine2 (after reconstructing the line if OCR broke it).


OCR candidate – first token in cleaned OCR text that starts with EP or EQ and is at least nine characters long.


Validation Pipeline
 Perform every step in order. Reject immediately on failure.
Prefix check


The first two characters must be EP or EQ (uppercase).


Length handling


If the candidate is longer than 9 chars, keep only the first 9 chars.


Example: EP86716111 → keep EP8671611.


If the candidate is shorter than 9 chars, reject it.


Digit check (positions 3‑9)


Characters 3‑9 must be digits 0‑9.


Any letter or symbol in this block causes rejection.


Final regex validation


Accept only if the post‑truncation token matches ^EP\d{{7}}$ or ^EQ\d{{7}}$.


Source‑Selection Logic
If the MRZ candidate passes validation, use it.


Else, if the OCR candidate passes, use it.


Else, set number to "".


Always store the raw OCR substring (even if later rejected) in original number.
Worked Examples (do not remove; add new ones as needed)
✅ Valid
EP86716111 → EP8671611 (extra digit dropped)


EP7682615 → EP7682615 (exact length)


EQ1234567 → EQ1234567 (valid EQ prefix)


❌ Invalid
EP0871511A → reject (non‑digit trailing ‘A’)


EP123456  → reject (too short)


EX1234567 → reject (wrong prefix)


EP12A4567 → reject (letter inside digit block)
country
Always set to the ISO‑alpha‑3 code ETH.


place of issue 
Place of Issue must always be set to "ETHIOPIA" in uppercase (no variations allowed), regardless of the data extracted from OCR.
Examples:
Issuing Authority: MAIN DEPARTMENT FOR IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY AFFAIRS


Place of Issue → ETHIOPIA ✅


name 
Ethiopian passports list the family name first in the visual zone, but do not flip the order.
Example: If OCR reads ARARSE URGEA, keep exactly ARARSE URGEA.
Compare the OCR name (visual zone) with mrzGivenNames from MRZ Line 1.
If they differ character‑for‑character, always choose the name from MRZ Line 1.


Example mismatch: FIREHIWOT AMARE (OCR) vs FIRIEHIWOT AMARE (MRZ) → use FIRIEHIWOT AMARE.


1. Capture Name from OCR:
Extract the entire given name from the OCR text and store it in the variable name.


Ensure the entire string, including multiple words or parts of the given name, is captured in full.


Apply the following cleaning steps to the extracted OCR name:


Replace hyphens ("‑") with spaces.


Remove apostrophes.


Strip diacritics (accent marks) from all characters.


Ensure the result is one continuous, cleaned-up name (no truncated portions).


2. Extract Name from MRZ (mrzGivenNames):
Capture all the given names from the MRZ text (from the mrzGivenNames field) after the surname and '<<'. Ensure all parts of the given name are captured, not just the first part.

 Example:


mrzGivenNames: "SOLOMON BEKELE"


First Name: "SOLOMON BEKELE" (include both names in the first name).


Apply the same cleaning steps (from step 1) to the mrzGivenNames.


3. Final Clean-up and Comparison:
Apply the following cleaning rules to both the OCR name and MRZ name:


Replace hyphens ("‑") with spaces.


Remove apostrophes.


Strip diacritics.


Put the entire cleaned name in First Name, including all parts of the given name. For example:


OCR Given Names: "RAHEL GEDAY"


First Name → "RAHEL GEDAY"


Middle Name → "" (empty)


OCR Given Names: "MULUALEM BZUNEH"


First Name → "MULUALEM BZUNEH"


Middle Name → "" (empty)


Compare with MRZ Given Names:


If the MRZ name is non-empty and longer than one character, compare the OCR name with the MRZ given names.


If there is a difference between the OCR name and MRZ given names, prioritize the MRZ given names and use the MRZ name as the final one.


Extract all given names from the MRZ, not just the first part.


Example:


OCR Given Names: "SOLOMON"


MRZ Given Names: "SOLOMON BEKELE"


First Name → "SOLOMON BEKELE" (prioritize MRZ name).
middle name
Always keep middle name as empty string (“”)
surname
If the surname in the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) differs from the surname in the MRZ (Machine Readable Zone), always prioritize the MRZ surname.
Example:
OCR surname: YAE HAILE


MRZ surname: HAILE


surname: Use HAILE (✅)


Make sure to remove "ETH" and anything remaining of it from surname and mrzSurname to ensure only the surname remains. Surname NEVER starts with “ETH”
Example 1:
OCR surname: AESWERAJ


MRZ surname: ETHWERAJ


surname: Use WERAJ (✅remove “ETH” from MRZ)


Example 2:
OCR surname: ETHERKO


MRZ surname: ETHERKO


surname: Use ERKO (✅remove “ETH” from MRZ)


Example 3:
OCR surname: ERKO


MRZ surname: HERKO


surname: Use ERKO (✅remove the remaining “H” of “ETH” from MRZ) 
mrzLine1
For EP numbers: P<ETH[SURNAME]<<[GIVEN_NAMES]<<<<…
For EQ numbers: PQETH[SURNAME]<<[GIVEN_NAMES]<<<<…
mrzSurname
Make sure to remove the prefix "ETH" when it is extracted by mistake.
MRZ surname: ETHWERAJ
mrzSurname: WERAJ (✅remove “ETH” from MRZ)
mrzLine2
If OCR splits the line with \n, concatenate adjacent fragments into a single 44‑character string before parsing.
Example:

EP73030602ETH9309119F2704047<<<<<
<<<<<<<
<<<<<<02
 
becomes

EP73030602ETH9309119F2704047<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<02
country of issue
Country of Issue must always be set to "ETHIOPIA" in uppercase (no variations allowed), regardless of the data extracted from OCR.
Examples:
Issuing Authority: MAIN DEPARTMENT FOR IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY AFFAIRS


Country of Issue → ETHIOPIA ✅


place of birth
If the OCR is a variant of “ADDIS ABABA” is detected, normalize it to ADDIS ABABA.
Examples:
ADP BABA ➜ ADDIS ABABA
JDIS ABABA ➜ ADDIS ABABA
ADDIS ABABA ➜ ADDIS ABABA (no change)
WONJI GEFERSA → WONJI GEFERSA (no change)
BATILEJANA → BATILEJANA (no change)
WOLLO → WOLLO (no change)
MESKAN → MESKAN (no change)
Do not alter other place names, even if they appear misspelled, unless they are clearly meant to be “ADDIS ABABA.”
Examples
GEMA ➜ GEMA (No Change — this is not a variation of ADDIS ABABA)
DILLA → DILLA (Not ADDIS ABABA)


Do not invent missing words. Only correct obvious OCR distortions.


Example: WINCHP ASHORT ➜ WINCHPASHORT (Correcting a spacing error but no meaning change)
In case OCR value is unapparent, resort to empty string → “”
Example:
OCR place of birth: “”
Place of Birth: “”


Replace any special characters like hyphens (-), slashes (/), single angle brackets (<), or other symbols in place names with a single space.


Example: T/MACHEW ➜ T MACHEW


Example: S/TSAEDENBA ➜ S TSAEDENBA


CASE 3: Kenya - KEN - Kenyan
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1[3‑5] = KEN or the extracted country field already equals KEN.
These rules supersede the master prompt only for the fields listed below.
number
Extract MRZ and OCR Candidates:


MRZ Candidate: Use characters 1–9 of the fully reconstructed mrzLine2 from the MRZ (Machine Readable Zone). Only alphanumeric characters and STOP when you see ‘<’. Remove it and remove everything after it.

Example:
MRZ Line 2 1-9: CK114314<6
MRZ Candidate: CK114314 (remove ‘<’ and everything after the ‘<’)
Example:
MRZ Line 2 1-9: B237205<<
MRZ Candidate: B237205 (remove ‘<’ and everything after the ‘<’)


OCR Candidate: Extract the first token that begins with AK, BK, or CK from the cleaned OCR text.


Validation Pipeline:


Prefix & Length Check:


Token must be at most 9 characters long.


Characters 1–2 must be one of AK, BK, or CK (uppercase).


Digit Check (positions 3–9):


Characters 3–9 must only be digits (0–9), no letters, spaces, or symbols allowed.


Final Regex Confirmation:


Ensure the token matches one of the following regular expressions:


^AK\d{7}$


^BK\d{7}$


^CK\d{7}$


If any candidate fails any of these checks, reject it.


Source Selection:


Use the validated MRZ candidate if it’s available and passes the validation checks and the OCR candidate is invalid. Otherwise, use OCR candidate.


If the MRZ candidate is not available, use the validated OCR candidate.


If neither is valid, output an empty string ("").


Let’s walk through some of the examples you provided:
Valid Case:


AK13851569:


Prefix: AK (valid)


Length: 9 characters (valid)


Digits: 13851569 (valid)


Final Regex: Matches ^AK\d{7}$ (valid)


Output: AK13851569 ✅



Invalid Case (Too Long):


BK12345678:


Length: 10 characters (invalid)


Trim to 9 characters: BK1234567 ✅


Invalid Case (Incorrect Prefix):


DK1234567:


Prefix DK is not valid.


Output: Rejected ❌


Invalid Case (Letter Inside Digits):


AK12345A7:


Contains letter A inside digit block (invalid).


Output: Rejected ❌


Invalid Case (Space Inside Token):


AK 1234567:


Contains space inside token (invalid).


Output: Rejected ❌


Invalid Case (Hyphen Inside Token):


AK1234-67:


Contains hyphen inside token (invalid).


Output: Rejected ❌
country
Always set to the ISO‑alpha‑3 code KEN.


place of birth
If the string contains “, KEN” or “KEN” (with or without spaces or minor OCR noise), keep only the substring before the comma.


Examples:


NYAMACHE, KEN → NYAMACHE
NAIROBI,KEN → NAIROBI
MOMBASA ,KEN → MOMBASA
BUTERE KEN → BUTERE
SIAYA,KEN → SIAYA 
MERU SOUTH KEN → MERU SOUTH


Remove stray commas and double‑spaces, but do not translate or expand the place name.


If “, KEN” is absent, retain the OCR text (after basic comma cleanup) exactly as seen.


Never invent missing words or alter spelling beyond obvious OCR fixes.


place of issue
Replace every hyphen - with a space, keep all other characters unchanged.


Example: REGISTRAR GENERAL‑HRE → REGISTRAR GENERAL HRE.
If the value looks like “GOVERNMENT OF KENYA”, normalize it to  “GOVERNMENT OF KENYA”.


Example: GOVERNMENT OF KENTA → GOVERNMENT OF KENYA.
country of issue
Always set to the uppercase word KENYA (no variations).


surname
Extract two versions


OCR surname (from the printed Surname label).


MRZ surname (from mrzLine1 before the first <).


Decision rules
If the MRZ surname is a single word (no spaces or hyphens) and the OCR surname has multiple words, always choose the OCR surname.


Example: MRZ NGANGA vs OCR NG'ANG'A → use NG ANG A.


If the OCR surname is split across two physical lines, merge them with a space.
Example:

OCR line1: ONG
OCR line2: ERA
becomes ONG ERA.


If both versions contain multiple words, choose the MRZ surname.


If both versions are single words, choose the MRZ surname.


Cleaning


Replace apostrophes ' and hyphens - with spaces, then collapse multiple spaces.


Do not change letter order or add diacritics.
name
Put the Entire Given Name in First Name:
Put the entire given name in First Name (keep all given names together).
Examples:
Given Names: BEATRICE NTHENYA


First Name → BEATRICE NTHENYA (Keep all given names) ✅


Middle Name → "" ✅


Given Names: GLADYS AOKO


First Name → GLADYS AOKO (Keep all given names) ✅


Middle Name → "" ✅


Compare with MRZ Given Names:
If the OCR given names differ from the MRZ given names, always prioritize MRZ given names.


Example:
Given Names (OCR): KEMGLADYS AOKO
MRZ Given Names: GLADYS AOKO
First Name → GLADYS AOKO ✅


middle name
Always keep middle name as empty string (“”)
MRZ Reference Formats (Read-Only, for Validation)
mrzLine1 (Kenyan Passports)
General Shape:
 P<KEN[SURNAME]<<[GIVEN NAMES]<<<…


Explanation:


P: Passport type.


<KEN: Country code for Kenya.


[SURNAME]: The surname (extracted from MRZ).


[GIVEN NAMES]: The given names (extracted from MRZ).
mrzLine2
Structure:


Begins with the 9-character passport number (AK/BK/CK + 7 digits), followed by a check digit.


Then KEN (indicating Kenya as the issuing country).


Birth Date (in YYMMDD format).


Sex.


Expiry Date (in YYMMDD format).


Additional information such as nationality, document number, etc.
Rule:
Replace special symbols like semicolon (;), apostrophes ('), backticks ( `), or any other symbols that might appear in the name or MRZ fields with a single space.
Examples:
DORAH MKANG'OMBE→ DORAH MKANG OMBE


GLADYS' AOKO → GLADYS AOKO


KEMGLADYSAOKO→KEMGLADYS AOKO`


Compliance Reminder
Do not translate Kenyan place names.


Do not output a passport number that fails the regex.


Purge all rejected tokens and logs after processing to meet GDPR requirements.

CASE 4: Sierra Leon – SLE - Sierra Leonean
Scope
 Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal SLE, or the extracted country field is already SLE.


 These rules override the master prompt solely for the field number (Sierra Leone passport number).
 All other fields continue to follow the master rules.
number
Extraction Sources (priority order)
MRZ candidate — first 9 characters of the fully reconstructed mrzLine2.


OCR candidate — first token in cleaned OCR text that begins with SLR (case‑insensitive).


Validation Pipeline
 Run the three checks in order for every candidate; reject on first failure.
Prefix & length check


Token must be exactly 9 characters.


Characters 1‑3 must be the uppercase string SLR.


Convert any lowercase slr to uppercase before validation.


Digit check (positions 4‑9)


Characters 4‑9 must be digits 0‑9.


Any letter, symbol, or space in this block makes the token invalid.


Final regex confirmation


Token must match ^SLR\d{{6}}$ after steps 1 and 2.


If a candidate fails any step, reject it.
Selection Logic
If both MRZ and OCR candidates are valid and identical, return that value.


If only one candidate is valid, use that one.


If both are valid but differ, keep the MRZ candidate.


If neither is valid, set number to "".


Store the raw OCR token (even if rejected) in original number.
Worked Examples (keep exactly; add more if you discover edge cases)
✅ Valid
SLR123456


SLR987654


slr000001 → converted to uppercase SLR000001 and accepted


❌ Invalid
SLE123456    → wrong prefix (SLE instead of SLR)


SLR12345     → too short (8 chars)


SLR1234567   → too long (10 chars)


SLR12A456    → non‑digit character inside numeric block


SL R123456   → embedded space


SLR12345-    → trailing symbol
Compliance Reminder
Do not pad or truncate valid 9‑character tokens.


Never output a passport number that fails the regex.


Purge rejected tokens and logs after processing (GDPR).


CASE 5: Uganda - UGA - Ugandan
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1[3‑5] = UGA or the extracted country field is already UGA.
These rules override the master prompt only for the field place of issue.
All other fields continue to follow the master rules.
place of issue
General Extraction Principle
Start with the full string exactly as it appears in the OCR text (after basic whitespace cleanup).


Never translate, reorder, or add words.


Never remove stand‑alone governmental identifiers such as the word “GOVT” unless the prefix‑rule in § 1.2 applies.


Prefix‑Cleanup Rule (city isolation)
If the OCR string matches any of the four patterns below (case‑insensitive, extra spaces allowed), extract only the trailing city / locality portion and discard everything before it:
GOVT UGANDA [CITY]


GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA [CITY]


UGANDA GOVT [CITY]


UGANDA GOVERNMENT [CITY]


Example conversions
GOVT UGANDA MBARARA     → MBARARA


Government of Uganda KAMPALA → KAMPALA


UGANDA GOVT ENTEBBE     → ENTEBBE


Uganda Government JINJA     → JINJA


If none of the four patterns match, retain the entire string (subject to § 1.3).
Country‑Code Suffix Rule
After applying § 1.2 (if triggered), check whether the resulting string ends with the 3‑letter country code UGA (possibly preceded by a comma or extra space).
If it does, remove the trailing UGA (and any preceding comma or space).


Example: KAMPALA UGA → KAMPALA


If it does not end with UGA, leave the text unchanged.


Additional examples
MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS UGA → MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS


DIRECTORATE OF PASSPORTS, KAMPALA UGA → DIRECTORATE OF PASSPORTS, KAMPALA


Minor OCR‑Noise Cleanup
Collapse multiple consecutive spaces to a single space.


Remove trailing commas or periods only if they appear immediately before the end of the string after § 1.3 processing.


Do not remove hyphens unless you are performing the UGA suffix deletion described above.


Worked Examples (keep exactly; add more as you encounter edge cases)
GOVT UGANDA KAMPALA         → KAMPALA


GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA GULU   → GULU


UGANDA GOVT FORT PORTAL     → FORT PORTAL


Uganda Government ARUA      → ARUA


ENYA RD KAMPALA UGA         → ENYA RD KAMPALA (suffix UGA removed)


KAMPALA                     → KAMPALA (no change)


IMMIGRATION HEADQUARTERS    → IMMIGRATION HEADQUARTERS (no change)


MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS UGA → MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS


GOVT UGANDA MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS KAMPALA → MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS KAMPALA

Purge intermediary strings and logs after processing to satisfy GDPR.




CASE 6: Nepal – NPL - Nepali
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal NPL or the extracted country field already equals NPL. 
number
Extract MRZ and OCR Candidates:
MRZ Candidate: Extract the first 9 characters from the fully reconstructed second line of the MRZ (Machine Readable Zone). Only alphanumeric characters (uppercase letters and digits) should be considered. If the character ‘<’ appears, remove it and everything after it.


Example:
MRZ Line 2 1-9: PA123456<7
MRZ Candidate: PA123456 (remove ‘<’ and everything after it)


MRZ Line 2 1-9: 123456<<
MRZ Candidate: 123456 (remove ‘<’ and everything after it)


OCR Candidate: Extract the first token that consists of alphanumeric characters, and the length of the token must be between 6 to 9 characters. It may start with "PA" but doesn't have to.


Validation Pipeline:
Length & Alphanumeric Check:


Token length must be between 6 and 9 characters long.


The token must only contain alphanumeric characters (uppercase letters A-Z and digits 0-9).


Prefix Check:


The token may or may not start with PA, but if it does, it should be followed by alphanumeric characters.


Final Regex Confirmation:


Ensure the token matches the following regular expression:


^[A-Z0-9]{6,9}$ (for any alphanumeric token of 6 to 9 characters)


If any candidate fails any of these checks, it should be rejected.
Source Selection:
Use the validated MRZ candidate if it’s available and passes the validation checks, and the OCR candidate is invalid.


Otherwise, use the validated OCR candidate.


If neither is valid, output an empty string ("").
Examples
Valid Case:


OCR Candidate: PA123456


Length: 8 characters (valid)


Alphanumeric: PA123456 (valid)


Final Regex: Matches ^[A-Z0-9]{6,9}$ (valid)


Output: PA123456 ✅


Valid Case (No "PA" Prefix):


OCR Candidate: 123456


Length: 6 characters (valid)


Alphanumeric: 123456 (valid)


Final Regex: Matches ^[A-Z0-9]{6,9}$ (valid)


Output: 123456 ✅


Invalid Case (Too Long):


OCR Candidate: PA12345678


Length: 10 characters (invalid)


Trim to 9 characters: PA1234567 (valid)


Output: PA1234567 ✅


Invalid Case (Contains Invalid Character):


OCR Candidate: PA12@3456


Contains special character "@" (invalid).


Output: Rejected ❌


Invalid Case (Too Short):


OCR Candidate: P12345


Length: 5 characters (invalid)


Output: Rejected ❌


Invalid Case (Space Inside Token):


OCR Candidate: PA 123456


Contains space inside token (invalid).


Output: Rejected ❌


Invalid Case (Hyphen Inside Token):


OCR Candidate: PA1234-56


Contains hyphen inside token (invalid).


Output: Rejected ❌


place of birth
Extraction Principle
Begin with the text exactly as it appears in the OCR output (after collapsing multiple spaces).


Never translate, abbreviate, or expand city / district names.


Perform only the suffix removal described in § 1.2 plus minor OCR noise fixes (e.g., double spaces → single space).


Suffix‑Removal Rule
 If the extracted string ends with a stand‑alone word that is one of:
PL


NPL


NFL


NEL


remove that trailing word (and any space directly before it). Leave the rest of the string unchanged.
Key points
The suffix must be a separate token at the end of the string.


Do not remove these letters if they are embedded inside a legitimate place name.


Example: PLACHOWK → keep as PLACHOWK (no change).
Remove all special characters like “(“, “)”, “\”, etc. and keep everything as is. Remove commas; translate non‑Latin to English; replace “‑”, “/”, “( )” with space; collapse duplicates in parentheses; auto‑correct clear OCR variants of MANILA; never add spaces if none existed. **Specifically, ensure that all parentheses are removed and the content within them is retained, with spaces replacing the parentheses.**


Worked Examples (keep exactly; add more when needed)
SINDHULI PL NPL     → SINDHULI


KATHMANDU PL        → KATHMANDU


BIRATNAGAR NPL      → BIRATNAGAR


POKHARA NFL         → POKHARA


LALITPUR NEL        → LALITPUR


GORKHA              → GORKHA (no suffix, no change)


DHARAN PLACHOWK     → DHARAN PLACHOWK (suffix letters inside name, keep)


CHITWAN  NPL        → CHITWAN (trailing spaces ignored)
NAWALPARASI (EAST)  → NAWALPARASI EAST
place of issue 
If the text in Place of Issue begins with "MOFA", then: Place of Issue = "MOFA"
Worked Examples
MOFA → Place of Issue: MOFA


MOFA, DEPARTMENT OF PASSPORT →  Place of Issue: MOFA


country of issue
If the text in Place of Issue begins with "MOFA", then: Place of Issue = "MOFA"
Worked Examples
MOFA → Country of Issue: NEPAL


MOFA, DEPARTMENT OF PASSPORT →  Country of Issue: NEPAL
Compliance Reminder
Do not remove or modify any part of the place name except the specified suffix tokens.


Do not translate Nepali place names.


Purge any intermediary strings or logs after processing to comply with GDPR.


CASE 7: India – IND – Indian
Scope
Apply this section only when:
mrzLine1 characters 3-5 equal "IND", OR


The previously extracted country field already equals "IND".


Important: Indian passports typically have two relevant pages:
Page 1 (Biographic Page): Contains main identity details and image (Name, Surname, DOB, Passport No, Dates, MRZ, etc.).


Page 2 (Additional Info Page): Contains parental names, spouse name, address, etc.


Critical Compliance:
Strictly adhere to specified extraction sources (Page 1 vs. Page 2).


Use exact label matching as specified.


Prioritize OCR fidelity, especially for place of birth. Avoid substitutions unless explicitly allowed for minor, high-confidence corrections.


number 
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND WHAT A VALID PASSPORT NUMBER LOOKS LIKE
A valid Indian passport number must meet all the following criteria:
Length: Exactly 8 characters long.


Structure:


Starts with 1 or 2 uppercase letters.


Followed by 6 or 7 digits.


Restrictions:


No spaces, dashes, slashes, symbols, or lowercase letters.


✅ Examples of Valid Passport Numbers:
Y4187040


AA449211


C5986765


T8888473


P9514027


R0742123


Z5876303


B7345371


X3230575


W9259311


N9723646


S0155122


❌ Invalid Examples (NEVER Extract These):
C03063072483320 → Too long (File Number)


U69057089 → Too many characters


U 6905708 → Contains a space


y6905708 → Contains a lowercase letter


T/8888473 → Contains a slash


AA44921 → Too short (only 7 characters)


47305665 → Starts with a number


STEP 2: WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE PASSPORT NUMBER
You must extract the passport number from two trusted locations only:
From the Printed Field on Page 1 (Biographic Page):


Look for the exact label “Passport No” (case-insensitive).


Extract the text immediately following this label.


From the MRZ (Machine-Readable Zone):


Look at MRZ Line 2 (the second of the two bottom lines).


The first 9 characters of this line contain the passport number and a check digit.


Only extract the first 8 characters (ignore the 9th check digit).


STEP 3: CLEAN THE VALUES
Once extracted, clean the values by applying these steps:
Remove all whitespace.


Remove all special characters like: /, -, ., :, _, or any symbols.


Convert all letters to uppercase.


Ensure the value is exactly 8 characters long (letters and digits only).


STEP 4: DECIDE WHICH VALUE TO KEEP
After cleaning, compare the two extracted values:
If both values are present and exactly the same: ✅ Use that value.


If both values are present but different: ✅ Use the MRZ value.


If only one value is present and valid: ✅ Use that value.


If neither value is valid: ❌ Return an empty string ("").


STEP 5: REJECTION RULES
Reject any value that meets any of the following criteria:
Length is not exactly 8 characters.


Contains slashes, dashes, dots, spaces, or symbols.


Comes from a label like “File Number” or “Old Passport Number”.


Found in barcodes or addresses.


Looks like a serial number or is too long (e.g., starts with C03...).


STEP 6: EXAMPLES FOR EVERY CASE
✅ Valid Cases:
OCR: "Passport No: U6905708"


MRZ Line 2: U6905708<3IND...


Result: Use: U6905708


OCR: Y 4187040 → cleaned → Y4187040


MRZ: Y4187040<5IND...


Result: Match → Use: Y4187040


OCR: "passport no: aa449211"


MRZ: AA449211<2IND...


Cleaned OCR: AA449211


Result: Use: AA449211


⚠️ Difference Case (OCR Error):
OCR: "Passport No: U690S708" (OCR error — misread 5 as S)


MRZ: U6905708<3IND...


Result: Use the MRZ value: U6905708 (since they differ)


❌ Reject Cases:
OCR: File No: C03063072483320


Reason: Too long → Reject.


MRZ: C0306307<4IND...


Reason: Invalid prefix from File Number → Reject.


Barcode: Y238747712345


Reason: More than 8 characters → Reject.


"Old Passport No: T4882211"


Reason: Wrong label → Reject.
name 
Objective:
Extract the complete given name(s) of the passport holder without cutting or missing any part.
🛠 Step-by-Step Instructions:
Extract Two Versions of the Given Name:


mrzGivenName:


From MRZ Line 1, extract everything after the first << until the end of the line.


ocrGivenName:


From Page 1, extract the value exactly next to the label “Given Name(s)” (case-insensitive exact match).


It will always be located below the surname in terms of Y-coordinates in the image.


Clean Both Extracted Values:


Replace every < character with a space.


Collapse multiple spaces into a single space.


Trim leading and trailing spaces.


Selection Rule:


If mrzGivenName is available (non-empty and readable), always use mrzGivenName even if it’s slightly different from ocrGivenName.


If mrzGivenName is missing, unreadable, or invalid, use ocrGivenName.


Important: Always use the full extracted string as-is after cleaning — no splitting, no guessing, no truncation.


❌ STRICT RULES: DO NOT:
Do not split the name into parts (keep the full name together as one field).


Do not pick only a part (e.g., avoid picking only "Kaur" if the full name is "Husanpreet Kaur").


Do not remove parts based on assumptions like family name, middle name, initials, etc.


Do not guess missing parts or correct perceived errors manually.


Do not pull from other fields like “Surname”, “Nationality”, etc.


MRZ Extract Examples:
MRZ Extract: <<JINCY → Final Name: JINCY


MRZ Extract: <<HETAL<GANESH → Final Name: HETAL GANESH


MRZ Extract: <<OMANA<JAMES<THOMAS → Final Name: OMANA JAMES THOMAS


MRZ Extract: <<SUMANDEEP<KAUR → Final Name: SUMANDEEP KAUR


MRZ Extract: <<RAFIQA<AKHTER → Final Name: RAFIQA AKHTER


⚡ Final Tip:
✅ Always trust MRZ fully if available, because it’s generated electronically.


✅ OCR should only be used as a backup if the MRZ fails.


surname 
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Extract two versions of the surname:


mrzSurname: From MRZ Line 1, extract the text after P<IND and before the first <<.


ocrSurname: From Page 1, extract the value next to the label "Surname" (case-insensitive exact match). It is typically located above the given names, usually being the topmost field in Y-coordinates in OCR.


Clean both extracted values:


Replace every < with a space.


Collapse multiple spaces into a single space.


Trim leading and trailing whitespace.


Selection Rule:


If both versions are available and different, always use mrzSurname.


If mrzSurname is unreadable or missing, use ocrSurname.


❌DO NOTS (ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN BEHAVIOR):
Do NOT include IND in the surname — The string "IND" is part of the MRZ prefix and must be excluded.


Do NOT shorten or guess surnames — Always extract the full printed surname exactly as it appears.


Do NOT extract anything from the "Given Name(s)" field and treat it as the surname.


Do NOT extract names from the address block, "Place of Birth", "Place of Issue", or any other unrelated sections.


Do NOT use "Name of Spouse" (from Page 2) as the surname:


Even if it appears near the top or bottom of the document.


Even if it contains a plausible name.


Even if the surname field is empty, never use the spouse name.


Do NOT use "Name of Mother" as the surname:


Even if it contains a plausible family name.


Even if the surname field is empty or unclear.


Even if the mother’s name appears higher or bolder than other fields, it is not the surname.


Do NOT mix names from different fields in the passport:


Each name field must come only from its exact label.


Do not assign the father’s name to the surname field, or the mother’s name to the given name, etc.


No substitutions between fields are allowed under any condition.


Do NOT infer or fabricate any part of the name based on proximity, alignment, or assumptions.
Examples:
MRZ: P<INDKOIKKARANPARAMBIL<JUDY<<JINCY → Extracted Surname: KOIKKARANPARAMBIL JUDY


OCR: KOIKKARANPARAMBIL JUDY → Result: Same as MRZ → Accept.


MRZ: P<INDSHARMA<KUMAR<<AMIT → Extracted Surname: SHARMA KUMAR (even if OCR says "SHAR")


middle name
Always keep middle name as empty string (“”)
gender 
OCR Candidate:
Source: Extract gender from the OCR text.


Format: The gender is typically represented as "M" for Male and "F" for Female in the OCR text.
MRZ Candidate:
Source: Extract gender from mrzLine2.


The gender is located at position 21 of mrzLine2.


Format: The gender is represented as "M" for Male, "F" for Female, or X for a non-binary gender (if applicable in the MRZ).


place of birth 
Extraction Source: Text associated with the "Place of Birth" label on Page 1 (Biographic Page).
Cleaning and Validation (Emphasis on Fidelity)
Prioritize OCR Fidelity
Extract text exactly as it appears in the OCR output. Do not substitute based on external knowledge or assumptions.
 Example: KAUSHAMBI UTTAR PRADESH should remain as KAUSHAMBI UTTAR PRADESH, not "KAUSHAMBI, UTTAR PRADESH".


Comma Handling
Remove all commas (,). If the comma separates city and state, replace it with a space.
 Example: KAUSHAMBI, UTTAR PRADESH -> KAUSHAMBI UTTAR PRADESH.
 If commas exist within other parts of the place name (e.g., NEW YORK, NY), remove the comma and ensure no additional space is added unless separating distinct words.


Special Character Normalization
Replace hyphens (-), slashes (/), and parentheses () with a single space.
 Example: MUMBAI-ANDHERI -> MUMBAI ANDHERI.
 Example: KOLKATA/DELHI -> KOLKATA DELHI.
 Example: (NEW DELHI) -> NEW DELHI.


Whitespace Cleanup
Collapse multiple spaces into one. Trim leading and trailing spaces from the extracted text.
 Example: MUMBAI MAHARASHTRA -> MUMBAI MAHARASHTRA.


Conservative OCR Correction
 Apply minor corrections only if the error is clear and of high confidence.
 Example: KOVvURU -> KOVVURU.
 Example: DELHI instead of DILHI.
 Note: Do not correct unless the error is absolutely clear and high-confidence.


Strict Anti-Hallucination
Do not replace or correct extracted text with a different place name, even if OCR output seems incomplete or misspelled.
Example: GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH -> Output should be GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH (❌ NOT VIJAYAWADA).
Example: HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT -> Output should be HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT (❌ NOT KAPAD KEDALA GUJARAT).


Preserve Full Place Name
 Ensure the entire place name is preserved, including city, district, and state.
 Example: KARAR WALA PUNJAB -> KARAR WALA PUNJAB.


Final Value
After applying the cleaning rules, the final value should be the cleaned, minimally corrected (if applicable), fully in UPPERCASE full string from OCR.
Example: After cleaning GUDUR, ANDHRA PRADESH, the final output should be GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH.


Examples
OCR: GUDUR, ANDHRA Pradesh
Cleaned: GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH
Final Place of Birth: "GUDUR ANDHRA PRADESH"


OCR: VIJAYAWADA
Cleaned: VIJAYAWADA
Final Place of Birth: "VIJAYAWADA"


OCR: KARAR MALA PUNJAB
Possible Correction: KARAR WALA PUNJAB
Final Place of Birth: "KARAR WALA PUNJAB" (Use correction only if high confidence)


OCR: HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT
Cleaned: HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT
Final Place of Birth: "HARIYALA KHEDA GUJARAT" (Prioritize fidelity if correction unsure)


OCR: HARIL, JHARKHAND
Cleaned: HARIL JHARKHAND
Final Place of Birth: "HARIL JHARKHAND"
place of issue 
Source:
The place of issue must be extracted from the OCR text, specifically from the field labeled "place of issue" or similar in the passport image.
Extraction Source: Text associated with the "Place of Issue" label on Page 1 (Biographic Page).
Critical: Do NOT confuse with "Place of Birth."


Assignment Rule: Use the cleaned OCR value (apply standard cleaning as per above).
If "Place of Issue" is blank or unreadable on Page 1, set place of issue to "".


Examples


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": RANCHI
Result: place of issue = "RANCHI"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": MUSKAT
Result: place of issue = "MUSKAT"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": CHANDIGARH
Result: place of issue = "CHANDIGARH"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": (blank/unreadable)
Result: place of issue = ""


country of issue 
Assignment Rule
If the place of issue is inside India (e.g., RANCHI, DELHI, MUMBAI), set country of issue = "INDIA".
If the place of issue is outside India (e.g., MUSCAT, DOHA, LONDON, DUBAI, etc.), set country of issue accordingly (e.g., OMAN, QATAR, UNITED KINGDOM, UAE, etc.).


If the place of issue is "", then the country of issue must be "".
Examples
Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": RANCHI
Result: country of issue = "INDIA"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": MUSKAT
Result: country of issue = "OMAN"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": CHANDIGARH
Result: country of issue = "INDIA"


Input (Page 1): "Place of Issue": (blank/unreadable)
Result: country of issue = ""
mother name
Objective: Extract only the first word of the mother's full name.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Go to Page 2 of the passport.


Locate the exact label "Name of Mother" (case-insensitive but exact wording).


Extract the full text immediately following this label:


The same line or the line immediately after.


Do not read from other areas.


Clean the extracted text:


Normalize whitespace (collapse multiple spaces into one).


Remove punctuation or unwanted characters.


Trim leading/trailing spaces.


Split the cleaned string by space.
Return only the first word as the mother’s name.
Make sure the name is a female name. If not, redo the OCR and see if the name was mistaken with Father’s name or Spouse name. 
Example:
Father Name: MANNU 
Mother Name: BABBU
Father Name: BABBU, Mother Name: MANNU. Switch because MANNU is female name in India and BABBU is male name
DO NOT
❌ Do not extract from "Name of Father" or "Name of Spouse" fields.


❌ Do not take more than one word.


❌ Do not merge words.


❌ Do not guess missing mother names.


❌ Do not hallucinate based on formatting or visual guesses.


Special Instructions for Missing or Blank Fields
If the "Name of Mother" field is missing, unreadable, or empty, return an empty string (""), never guess from other fields.


FINAL CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES
Must Do:
✅ Use exact label matches only.


✅ Never guess names based on nearby text.


✅ Always fully clean extracted text.


✅ Never swap or confuse fields (Father ≠ Mother).


✅ The Father’s name will always be positioned above the Mother’s name in the document. Ensure that the Y-coordinate of the text for "Name of Father / Legal Guardian" is higher than the Y-coordinate for "Name of Mother" to avoid confusion.


Must Not Do:


❌ Always extract from the correct field.


❌ Never use spouse names, addresses, etc.


❌ Return an empty string if missing.


❌ Never hallucinate missing names.

father name 
Objective: Extract the full name of the father or legal guardian.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Go to Page 2 of the passport.


Locate the exact label "Name of Father / Legal Guardian" (case-insensitive but exact wording).


Extract the full text directly following this label:


Either on the same line.


Or the line immediately after if wrapped.


Do not read from any other area.


Clean the extracted text:


Normalize spaces (collapse multiple spaces into one).


Remove surrounding noise characters (punctuation like ., ,, ;, etc.).


Trim leading and trailing spaces.


Return the entire cleaned string as the father's name.
DO NOT
❌ Do not extract from any label other than "Name of Father / Legal Guardian".


❌ Do not infer from "Name of Mother", "Name of Spouse", or any address section.


❌ Do not split, truncate, shorten, or guess missing parts of the name.


❌ Do not correct perceived "errors" in the name (trust what is written).


Special Instructions for Missing or Blank Fields
If the "Name of Father / Legal Guardian" field is missing, unreadable, or blank, return an empty string (""), not a guess from any other field.
CASE 8: Uzbekistan - UZB - Uzbek
Scope
Apply the following instructions only to these four fields: number, surname, name, middle name, and place of issue.
 All other fields continue to follow the master prompt.
number
Required Format
Exactly 9 characters.


First 2 characters: uppercase English letters A–Z.


Last 7 characters: digits 0–9.


Extraction & Selection Process
Extract a candidate from MRZ Line 2.


Validate the MRZ candidate:


If it is 9 chars, 2 letters + 7 digits, mark as valid.


If it is longer than 9, keep only the first 9 chars and re‑validate.


If it is shorter than 9, mark as invalid.


Extract an OCR candidate (first token in cleaned OCR text that looks like 2 letters + 7 digits).


Decide:


If only one candidate is valid, use it.


If both are valid but differ, prefer MRZ.


If both are valid and match, use either.


If neither is valid, set number to "".


Examples (unchanged originals + new)
✅ Valid cases
MRZ "AB1234567", OCR "XY7654321" → result AB1234567 (MRZ valid and used).


MRZ "CD987654321" → trimmed to CD9876543; OCR "EF1234567" → result CD9876543 (trimmed MRZ).


MRZ "KL9876543", OCR "MN1234567" → result KL9876543 (both valid, MRZ wins).


New: MRZ "QR0000000" (valid), OCR missing → result QR0000000.


✅ Fallback to OCR
MRZ "GH12345" (too short), OCR "IJ7654321" → result IJ7654321.


❌ No valid number
MRZ "123456", OCR "AB12C4567" → result "".


More invalid edge cases
"AB123456" (8 chars) → reject.


"AB12345678" (10 chars) → reject.


"A91234567" (only one letter) → reject.


"AB12345X7" (letter inside digit block) → reject.


surname
Read everything before the first << in mrzLine1.


Keep all words exactly as they appear (spaces, hyphens, apostrophes → convert to spaces, then collapse multiple spaces).


Do not discard extra words.


Examples (unchanged)
"ABDURASULOVA"


"RAKHIMOVA SULTONOVA"


name 
In mrzLine1, locate the substring between the first << and the next <.


The first word in that block is the first name.


Example (unchanged)
"DILDORA"


middle name 
Still within the given‑name block (after the first name, before any <<< markers):


If a second word exists, store it as middle name.


Otherwise, leave middle name empty.


Example (unchanged)
From "DILDORA<AKHMEDOVNA" → middle name = "AKHMEDOVNA"


place of issue
Extract the entire string as printed in OCR.
If the string starts with MIA followed by a space and a number (MIA ####), convert the entire field to "Uzbekistan".


Examples (unchanged):


"MIA 26296" → "Uzbekistan"


"MIA 12345" → "Uzbekistan"


For all other strings, keep them exactly as extracted (collapse multiple spaces, remove trailing spaces).


Compliance Notes
Never pad a number to reach 9 characters—only trim if longer.


Never rearrange or translate surnames and place names.


Purge all rejected tokens and logs after processing to comply with GDPR.


CASE 9: Bangladesh - BGD - Bengali
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal BGD or the extracted country field already equals BGD.
These rules override the master prompt only for the field place of issue. All other fields continue to follow the master rules.
place of issue
Extraction Principle
Capture the entire “Place of Issue” string exactly as printed in the OCR text (after collapsing multiple spaces).


Do not drop governmental identifiers such as DIP; keep every word.


Hyphen / Slash Normalization
 After extraction, replace every hyphen - and every slash / with a single space.
 Then collapse any double spaces created by this replacement into one.
Examples (unchanged and additional)
Place of Issue: DIP/DHAKA   → DIP DHAKA


Place of Issue: DIP-DHAKA   → DIP DHAKA


Place of Issue: DIP/CHITTAGONG → DIP CHITTAGONG


Place of Issue: DIP-SYLHET     → DIP SYLHET


Place of Issue: DHAKA          → DHAKA (no change)


Place of Issue: DIP DHAKA     → DIP DHAKA (collapse spaces)


No Other Transformations
Do not translate, abbreviate, or expand place names.


Do not remove prefixes/suffixes other than replacing - and /.


Preserve letter casing as detected (the master prompt may upper‑case globally if desired).


Compliance Reminder
The only permitted modification is replacing slashes and hyphens with spaces plus collapsing repeated spaces.


Purge intermediary strings and logs after processing to comply with GDPR.


CASE 10: Cameroon - CMR - Cameroonian
Scope
 Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal CMR or the extracted country field already equals CMR. These rules override the master prompt only for the name‑related fields shown below. All other fields remain governed by the master rules.
surname
Locate mrzLine1.
Everything from character 6 onward until the first double‑arrow separator << is the surname block.


Replace each single arrow < inside that block with a space, then collapse multiple spaces to one.


Keep the resulting string as surname exactly—do not translate, reorder, or drop words.


Example (keep exactly)
MRZ: P<CMRKIJIKA<ROSETTE<<BANYE<<


Surname block = KIJIKA<ROSETTE


surname → KIJIKA ROSETTE
name
In mrzLine1, identify the substring after the first <<.


The first word (up to the next <) is the first name.


Convert embedded < to spaces only after isolating the first word.


Example (unchanged)
Substring after first << = BANYE<<


First word = BANYE


name → BANYE
middle name
Any remaining word(s) in the given‑name zone after the first name but before the triple arrow <<< are treated as middle name.


Collapse < to spaces; if no additional word exists, leave middle name empty.


(No example was provided; follow master‑prompt logic for middle names.)
OCR vs MRZ Preference
If the names extracted from OCR and MRZ differ in any character, always keep the MRZ version for surname, name, and middle name.


OCR names are only used when the MRZ zone is unreadable or missing.
Worked Example (complete flow)
MRZ Line 1:
 P<CMRKIJIKA<ROSETTE<<BANYE<<
Surname block = KIJIKA<ROSETTE → KIJIKA ROSETTE


Given‑name block after first << = BANYE<<


First name = BANYE


No additional word → middle name = ""


Resulting fields:
"surname":     "KIJIKA ROSETTE"
"name":        "BANYE"
"middle name": ""

Compliance Reminder
Only convert single < symbols to spaces; do not alter letter order or add punctuation.


Preserve uppercase letters exactly as found (global upper‑casing may be handled by the master prompt).


Purge intermediate parsing strings and logs after processing to meet GDPR.
CASE 11: Pakistan - PAK - Pakistani
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal PAK or the previously extracted country field already equals PAK. These rules override the master prompt only for the fields surname, name, middle name, place of birth, and number. All other fields continue to follow the master rules.
Name‑Related Fields
surname
In mrzLine1, capture everything between character 6 and the first << separator.


Replace each single arrow (<) in this block with a space, then collapse multiple spaces.


Preserve the resulting string as surname—do not translate, reorder, or drop words.


name
Locate the substring after the first << in mrzLine1 and before the next <.
Convert embedded single arrows (<) to spaces.


The entire resulting block (one or two words) is the name.

 Rule of thumb — if two given names appear, both are part of name; never store the second one in middle name.


middle name
Pakistani passports do not store middle names separately in the MRZ.


Always set middle name to an empty string "".


Examples (unchanged)
MRZ Line 1:
 P<PAKRAMZAN<<CHAUDHARY<WASEEM<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


surname → RAMZAN


name    → CHAUDHARY WASEEM


middle name → ""


MRZ Line 1:
 P<PAKMALIK<<AHMAD<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


surname → MALIK


name    → AHMAD


middle name → ""


place of birth
Extract the full string exactly as written in the OCR text (collapse double spaces to one).


If the string ends with the stand‑alone token PAK (preceded by a space), remove that trailing PAK and the preceding space.


Do not translate or otherwise alter the place name.


Do not remove any other words, even governmental or regional abbreviations.


Examples (unchanged)
MIRPUR AK PAK → MIRPUR AK


LAHORE PAK    → LAHORE


RAWALPINDI    → RAWALPINDI (no change)


Extra example: KARACHI PAK → KARACHI


number
Extraction Rule
Always take the passport number from the beginning of mrzLine2.


Ignore the OCR‑extracted number unless it is identical to the MRZ number.


Validation & Trimming
Start with the first 9 characters of mrzLine2.


Confirm that the pattern is two uppercase letters plus seven digits.


If mrzLine2 is longer than 9 characters, trim after the 9th character; if shorter than 9, mark as invalid and leave number empty.


If both MRZ and OCR numbers match and are valid, either may be used (effect is identical).


Examples (unchanged)
MRZ: BB92161836PAK8303051M26010768130203756183<92


Extracted number → BB9216183 ✅


OCR number G1311862 ignored.


MRZ: KL9876543…, OCR MN1234567


Both valid but different → use KL9876543 (MRZ wins).


MRZ: GH12345 (too short), OCR IJ7654321


MRZ invalid → fallback to OCR, result IJ7654321.


Compliance Reminder
Do not invent or rearrange given names; Pakistani MRZ places all given names in the second block.


middle name is always empty.


Only remove the literal suffix PAK from place of birth; do not touch other components.


Purge intermediary strings and logs after processing to satisfy GDPR.

CASE 12: Sri Lanka – LKA – Sri Lankan
Scope
Activate this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal LKA or the previously extracted country field already equals LKA. 
surname
Locate mrzLine1.
Read every character starting at position 6 (the first character after the country code) up to—but not including—the first double‑arrow separator <<.


Within that substring, replace each single arrow < with a space, then collapse multiple spaces to one.


Preserve the resulting string verbatim as surname.


Do not translate, reorder, or remove any words.


Example 1
Substring before << = PORAMA<MANNAGE


Convert < to space → PORAMA MANNAGE


surname = PORAMA MANNAGE
Example 2
Substring before << = WIKRAMA<HENALAGE


Convert < to space → WIKRAMA HENALAGE


surname = WIKRAMA HENALAGE
Example 3
Substring before << = MADIGAPOLA<LEKAMGE


Convert < to space → MADIGAPOLA LEKAMGE


surname = MADIGAPOLA LEKAMGE
Compliance Reminder
Only transform single < characters into spaces; all other formatting stays intact.


Upper‑casing or global space‑normalisation (if any) should follow the master prompt’s convention.


Purge temporary parsing strings and logs after processing to satisfy GDPR.
name
Put the Entire Given Name in First Name:
First Name:


Put the entire given name in First Name (keep all given names together).



Examples:
Given Names: DEHEMI SANJANA DASANAYAKA


First Name → DEHEMI SANJANA DASANAYAKA (Keep all given names) ✅


Given Names: NUSHALI SUJANTHA FONSEKA


First Name → NUSHALI SUJANTHA FONSEKA (Keep all given names) ✅



Compare with MRZ Given Names:
If the OCR given names differ from the MRZ given names, check the following:


If the OCR name is much longer than the MRZ extracted names, keep the OCR given names, as some names were too long to fit in the MRZ.


Just check that the equivalent parts match.



Example:
Given Names (OCR): MADUSHANI KAUSHALYA SANJEEWAN JAYATHISSA


MRZ Given Names: MADUSHANI KAUSHALYA


First Name → MADUSHANI KAUSHALYA SANJEEWAN JAYATHISSA ✅
middle name
Always keep middle name as empty string (“”)
place of issue 
Rule:
If the Place of Issue is exactly or looks like "AUTHORITY COLOMBO", then:


Set Place of Issue = "COLOMBO"


Set Country of Issue = "SRI LANKA"



Examples:
Place of Issue (OCR): AUTHORITY COLOMBO
Place of Issue → COLOMBO ✅ (Remove AUTHORITY)


Place of Issue (OCR): AUTHORITY COLO
Place of Issue → COLOMBO ✅ (Remove AUTHORITY and fix OCR mistake)


Place of Issue (OCR): COLOMBO
Place of Issue → COLOMBO ✅ (Keep COLOMBO)
country of issue
Rule:
If the Place of Issue is exactly or looks like "AUTHORITY COLOMBO", then:


Set Country of Issue = "SRI LANKA"



Examples:
Place of Issue (OCR): AUTHORITY COLOMBO
Country of Issue → "SRI LANKA" ✅


Place of Issue (OCR): AUTHORITY COLO
Country of Issue → "SRI LANKA" ✅


Place of Issue (OCR): COLOMBO
Country of Issue → "SRI LANKA" ✅
CASE 13: Brazil – BRA - Brazilian
Scope
 Activate this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal BRA or the extracted country field already equals BRA. These rules override the master prompt only for the fields place of issue, country of issue, and place of birth.  All other fields follow the master rules.
place of issue
Extract the string exactly as printed in the OCR text (collapse multiple spaces).
Pattern test: If the string matches the pattern SR/PF/[STATE‑CODE]


(SR slash PF slash two‑letter state),


replace the entire field with the word "Brazil".


Examples ✅


SR/PF/SP → Brazil


SR/PF/RN → Brazil


If the string does not match that pattern, keep it unchanged (after collapsing double spaces).


Example: MINISTERIO DAS RELACOES EXTERIORES → MINISTERIO DAS RELACOES EXTERIORES


country of issue
If place of issue has been converted to "Brazil" under § 1, then set country of issue = "Brazil".


Otherwise, extract country of issue from OCR as the master prompt dictates (no special Brazilian rule).


place of birth
Begin with the OCR text exactly as written (collapse multiple spaces).


Slash rule: If the string contains a forward slash /, keep only the part before the first slash.


Example ✅ NATAL/RN → NATAL


Comma rule: If the string contains a comma ,, replace the comma with a single space but retain everything on both sides.


Example ✅ LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA → LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA


Do not translate, abbreviate, or drop any other valid components of the place name.


Compliance Reminder
Only the specific transformations in §§ 1–3 are allowed.


Do not translate Brazilian place names or governmental acronyms beyond the rules given.


Purge temporary strings and logs after processing to satisfy GDPR.


CASE 14: Myanmar – MMN - Burmese
Scope
 Trigger this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal MMN or the previously extracted country field already equals MMN. These rules override the master prompt only for the name‑related fields (surname, name, and middle name). All other fields remain governed by the master rules.
Name‑Extraction Logic for Burmese Passports
Source priority


Start with the OCR full‑name string.


If the MRZ full‑name block contains additional words not present in OCR, merge them so that you use the most complete set of words.


If OCR and MRZ contain the same words, you may use either.


Split into tokens


Replace hyphens - with spaces.


Collapse multiple consecutive spaces into one.


Remove stray punctuation (periods, commas) only when clearly an OCR artefact.


Example: "KYE-THI AUNG." → KYE THI AUNG


Assign components


Surname (surname) = the final word in the token list.


Example: tokens [NU, NU, WAI] → surname WAI


First name (name) = all preceding words in their original order, joined by a single space.


Example: [NU, NU] → NU NU


Middle name (middle name)


Burmese names do not have a formal middle‑name concept; always set this field to an empty string "".


Capitalisation


Follow the master prompt’s global rule (usually uppercase for MRZ alignment).


Do not attempt title‑case corrections that could alter authentic Burmese spelling.


Worked Examples (keep exactly; add more as you encounter edge cases)
OCR Name: NU NU WAI


surname → WAI


name    → NU NU


middle name → ""


OCR Name: KYE-THI AUNG


Normalise → KYE THI AUNG


surname → AUNG


name    → KYE THI


middle name → ""


MRZ adds a missing word


OCR: NAY LIN


MRZ block: NAY LIN OO


Use full MRZ string NAY LIN OO


surname → OO


name    → NAY LIN


Single‑word name (rare but possible)


OCR & MRZ: SANDAR


surname → SANDAR


name    → "" (empty because no preceding word)


middle name → ""


Compliance Reminder
Never reorder Burmese name elements; only split based on final‑word rule.


Never fabricate or translate Burmese names.


Purge temporary parsing strings and logs after processing (GDPR compliance).

CASE 15: Russia – RUA - Russian
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal RUA (or RUS, if the MRZ uses the ISO‑alpha‑3 code) or the extracted country field already equals RUA. These rules override the master prompt solely for the fields place of birth and place of issue. All other fields continue to follow the master rules.
place of birth
Start with the OCR text exactly as written (collapse multiple spaces).
Standardise to "RUSSIA" when any of the following is detected (case‑insensitive; works for Cyrillic and Latin scripts):


A Russian oblast indication (e.g., ИРКУТСКАЯ ОБЛ., IRKUTSKAYA OBL., ТВЕРСКАЯ ОБЛ.).


A Russian city name (e.g., МОСКВА, MOSCOW, САНКТ‑ПЕТЕРБУРГ).


The word РОССИЯ or its Latin equivalent RUSSIA.


A USSR reference combined with a location known to be inside current‑day Russia (e.g., СССР МОСКВА).


If none of the above triggers, leave the place of birth exactly as extracted (after comma‑to‑space conversion handled by the master prompt).


Examples
ИРКУТСКАЯ ОБЛ. → RUSSIA


MOSCOW → RUSSIA


РОССИЯ → RUSSIA


СССР, НОВОСИБИРСК → RUSSIA


KIEV, USSR → Keeps original (not modern‑day Russia)
place of issue
Extract the full OCR string (collapse multiple spaces).
Pattern‑trigger replacement:


If the string contains any of the following prefixes followed by one or more digits (optional spaces allowed), replace the entire field with Russia:


МВД


ГУ МВД


МУ МВД


ОВД


РОВД


ФМС


УФМС


ГУВМ


Matching must be case‑insensitive and recognise both Cyrillic and transliterated Latin (OVD, FMS, etc.) forms.


If the string does not match any of these patterns, keep it as originally extracted (after hyphen‑ and slash‑normalisation from the master prompt, if applicable).


##### Examples
МВД 78023         → Russia ✅


ГУ МВД 77001      → Russia ✅


ОВД121            → Russia ✅


УФМС 49002        → Russia ✅


Office of Internal Affairs, Moscow → kept unchanged (no trigger phrase)


Compliance Reminder
Only perform the specific replacements described; never translate or drop other content.


Purge intermediate strings and logs after processing to satisfy GDPR.


CASE 16: Spain - ESP - Spanish
Scope
Use this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 are ESP, or the previously extracted country field is ESP. These instructions override the master prompt solely for the field place of issue. All other fields still follow the master rules.
Place of Issue
Extract verbatim
Capture the “Place of Issue” string from OCR exactly as written (after collapsing multiple spaces).


Pattern check


If the string contains the prefix “DGP” (case‑insensitive) followed immediately by one or more digits.


A single space between DGP and the digits is allowed.


Replacement rule


When the pattern in Step 2 is detected, replace the entire field with the word “Spain.”


If the pattern is not detected, keep the field exactly as extracted in Step 1.


Examples


DGP 08055D6P1 → Spain


dgp 123456 → Spain


DGP08099 → Spain


MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR → (kept unchanged)


MADRID → (kept unchanged)
CASE 17: Hong Kong - HKG - Hong Kongese
Scope
Apply this section only when mrzLine1 characters 3‑5 equal HKG, or the extracted country field already equals HKG. These instructions override the master prompt only for the field country of issue. Every other field continues to follow the master rules.
country of Issue
Detect special phrase
Inspect the OCR “Place of Issue” text.


If it contains PCG HONG KONG (case‑insensitive), apply Step 2.
Set country of issue
Force the field country of issue to the string “HONG KONG”.
Retention rule
Do not override the value with “China.”


If the special phrase is absent, revert to the master prompt’s normal extraction logic.


Example


Place of Issue: PCG HONG KONG → country of issue = HONG KONG

<USER>
Step-by-Step Extraction and Validation Process
1. OCR Pass 1: Initial Extraction
Action: Run the highest-accuracy OCR engine on the passport image.


Extraction: Attempt to extract all the necessary fields for the JSON based on layout rules, keywords, and patterns.


Initial Cleaning: Apply basic cleanup to the raw OCR data:


Trim leading and trailing whitespace.


Normalize multiple spaces within text (e.g., replace consecutive spaces with a single space).


Correct common OCR misreads (e.g., interpreting "O" as "0", "I" as "1" when contextually applicable).


Output: Store the cleaned results in a temporary structure called OCR_Result_Pass1.


2. Validation Pass 1: Field-Level Check
Action: Validate the fields extracted in OCR_Result_Pass1.


Validation:


Ensure the format of each field is correct (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY for dates).


Ensure the length is correct (e.g., passport number must be 9 characters).


Ensure the content matches expected values (e.g., country codes, gender codes).


Ensure logical consistency (e.g., birth date must be before issue date).


Output: Store the validation status in Validation_Status_Pass1 (e.g., {{ isValid: true, reason: null } or { isValid: false, reason: "Invalid format" }}).


3. OCR Pass 2: Secondary Extraction
Action: Run the same OCR engine on the same image to capture potential variations in OCR results.


Extraction: Repeat the extraction process and apply the same cleanup rules as in OCR Pass 1.


Output: Store the results in OCR_Result_Pass2.


4. Validation Pass 2: Field-Level Check
Action: Validate the fields extracted in OCR_Result_Pass2 using the same rules as in Pass 1.


Output: Store the validation status in Validation_Status_Pass2.


5. Field-Level Consolidation Based on Validation Status
Action: Consolidate the data by comparing the results of Pass 1 and Pass 2.


If Pass 1 is valid and Pass 2 is invalid, use the data from Pass 1.


If Pass 1 is invalid and Pass 2 is valid, use the data from Pass 2.


If both passes are valid, prioritize Pass 1.


If both passes are invalid, use the Pass 1 data tentatively (with reason flags for review).


Output: Create a consolidated dataset Consolidated_Data and a corresponding status tracker Consolidated_Status.


6. MRZ Extraction & Validation
Action: Extract MRZ fields from mrzLine1 and mrzLine2:


mrzLine1: Extract the full line with padding <.


mrzLine2: Extract the full line with padding <.


mrzPassportNumber: Extract from positions 1-9 in mrzLine2.


mrzDateOfBirth: Extract from positions 14-19 in mrzLine2 (convert from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY).


mrzDateOfExpiry: Extract from positions 22-27 in mrzLine2 (convert from YYMMDD format to DD/MM/YYYY).


mrzSex: Extract from position 21 in mrzLine2.


mrzSurname: Extract from positions 6 to first << in mrzLine1.


mrzGivenNames: Extract from the remaining part of mrzLine1 after the surname.


7. Final Cross-Validation & Reconciliation
Action: Reconcile the data from OCR_Result_Pass1, OCR_Result_Pass2, and MRZ data:


If both OCR and MRZ data are valid but differ, MRZ data takes precedence.


If either OCR or MRZ data is invalid, use the valid data from the other source.


For fields like issue date, expiry date, birth date, ensure the dates are logically ordered (e.g., expiry date should come after issue date).


8. Date Sanity Check
Action: Verify that the birth date is less than or equal to the issue date, and the issue date is less than the expiry date. If not, prioritize MRZ dates if valid.


9. Final JSON Construction
Action: Assemble the final validated JSON object using the consolidated data from Consolidated_Data after all validation, reconciliation, and sanity checks.


Ensure:


Invalid or missing fields are set to empty string ("").
All fields are output in FULL UPPERCASE format.
The output JSON structure strictly follows the required key order.
Please extract and return the data in exactly the JSON structure below (no extra keys, no extra text).
